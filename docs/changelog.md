## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### 🚀 Improvements
- Token Optimization Phase 1 — `GEMINI.md` reduced from 32 `@` imports to 3 essential skills, saving 92% tokens per turn (~100K → ~8K)
- Token Optimization Phase 2 — Top 5 largest skills slimmed by 72-84% (105K bytes saved total):
  - `cm-project-bootstrap` 40K → 6.6K, `cm-ux-master` 27K → 5.6K, `cm-safe-deploy` 23K → 4.1K, `cro-methodology` 22K → 4.9K, `cm-ads-tracker` 19K → 5.3K
- Progressive Disclosure Templates — 10 template files extracted to `templates/` directories for on-demand loading via `view_file`, eliminating accuracy trade-offs from slimming
- Vibe Coding landing page (`vibe-coding.html`) — guide for non-developers
- Parallel Coding landing page (`parallel-coding.html`) — side-by-side comparison with/without CodyMaster

- Requirement Tracing — FR/NFR IDs in `cm-planning` for L2+ projects
- Outputs Convention — standardized `.cm/outputs/` directory structure
- Skill Gap Detector — auto-detects missing skills during planning and execution
